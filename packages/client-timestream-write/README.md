## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @effect-aws/client-timestream-write
```

## Usage

With default TimestreamWriteClient instance:

```typescript
import { TimestreamWrite } from "@effect-aws/client-timestream-write";

const program = TimestreamWrite.listTables(args);

const result = pipe(
  program,
  Effect.provide(TimestreamWrite.defaultLayer),
  Effect.runPromise,
);
```

With custom TimestreamWriteClient instance:

```typescript
import { TimestreamWrite } from "@effect-aws/client-timestream-write";

const program = TimestreamWrite.listTables(args);

const result = await pipe(
  program,
  Effect.provide(
    TimestreamWrite.baseLayer(() => new TimestreamWriteClient({ region: "eu-central-1" })),
  ),
  Effect.runPromise,
);
```

With custom TimestreamWriteClient configuration:

```typescript
import { TimestreamWrite } from "@effect-aws/client-timestream-write";

const program = TimestreamWrite.listTables(args);

const result = await pipe(
  program,
  Effect.provide(TimestreamWrite.layer({ region: "eu-central-1" })),
  Effect.runPromiseExit,
);
```

or use `TimestreamWrite.baseLayer((default) => new TimestreamWriteClient({ ...default, region: "eu-central-1" }))`
